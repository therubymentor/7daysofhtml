    A picture is worth a thousand words
</h1>

<p>An image in HTML is represented by the &lt;img&gt;
tag. That tag can be styled with CSS like anything else
in HTML. Let's give it a width of 50% and float it to
the left hand side..</p>

<pre>
h1 img {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
</pre>

<p>Now let's add some whitespace so the text isn't all
up in the photo's koolaid. Add the followinf CSS to
the h1 img styles:</p>

<pre>
margin-right: 1em;
</pre>

<h2>Did you know?</h2>

<p>You can also have images as the background of a
HTML element. So now in the HTML section create a
div and give it the class of paralax:</p>

<pre>
&lt;div class="blurry"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<div class="blurry"></div>

<p>Notice it has no HTML content of it's own, now
style it in the CSS pane by writing a block for the
class blurry. Classes are denoted in CSS by a '.'
character:</p>

<pre>
div.blurry {
  background: url('https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/reveal-parallax-1.jpg');
  height: 400px;
  width: 100%;
  opacity: 0.8;
}
</pre>

<p>Now we will add an image as an element inside that 
div.</p>

<pre>
&lt;div class="blurry"&gt;
&lt;img src="http://hd.wallpaperswide.com/thumbs/simple_blue_background-t2.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<p>You can also add text to that div. Add "Pretty cool eh?"
to the div and you are done for the day!</p>
