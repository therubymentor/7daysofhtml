<h1>Day 3! Totally Tablular Dood =D</h1>

<p>Calendars, spreadsheets, and even Jeopordy boards are
all represented as <em>Tabular Data</em>. But enough
yap yap</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>mon</th>
    <th>tue</th>
    <th>wed</th>
    <th>thu</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>20</td>
    <td>21</td>
    <td>22</td>
    <td>23</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>27</td>
    <td>28</td>
    <td>29</td>
    <td>30</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>You can check out the code that made that in 
the HTML editor to the left and top. You know the 
drill by now.</p>

Now you fill in the missing <em>headings</em>
and row <em>data</em>. <strong>th</strong> indeed 
stands for <strong>table heading</strong> and 
<strong>td</strong> is <strong>table data</strong>
can you guess what <strong>tr</strong> means?

<p>Did you fill out the missing data so all the days 
are represented? Next we will add some <em>STYLE</em>
to that shiznit!</p>

<p>Locate the CSS section to the left and bottom. In
there, add an element definition like so:</p>

<pre>
table {

}
</pre>

<p>But we don't really want to style the <em>table</em>
we want to style the TH and TDs:</p>

<pre>
table th {
  text-transform: uppercase;
  font-family: helvetica, sans-serif;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #333;
}

table td {
  font-family: courier, serif;
  letter-spacing: 1px;
}
</pre>

<p>Type (if you copy/paste you are 
<strong>CHEATING</strong> yourself, not me. I'm good.
Do whatcha wanna dooo.</p>


<table>
  <tr>
    <th>mon</th>
    <th>tue</th>
    <th>wed</th>
    <th>thu</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>20</td>
    <td>21</td>
    <td>22</td>
    <td>23</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>27</td>
    <td>28</td>
    <td>29</td>
    <td>30</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Ok, I lied, we need to style the <strong>table</strong>
too. See that space in our TH line?</p>
<p>Kick rocks stoopid space!</p>

<pre>
table {
  border-spacing: 0px;
}
</pre>

<p>What you just did was <em>override</em> the defaults
se by the <em>browser</em>. At some point you will come
across the concept in CSS of a <em>reset</em> file.</p>

<p>That is just a file that 'flattens' all the browsers
into a single set of settings instead a large set of
disperate values. Yeah, they leave it to us supermen
(and supergals) to fix these sorts of things.</p>

But now that <strong>table</strong> is all <em>jammed</em>
up against the paragraphs on this page. Let's fix that:</p>

<pre>
table {
  border-spacing: 0px;
  margin: 2em;
}
</pre>

<p>Just for 'shits and giggles' as my ol' man used to say,
let's make this text bareable again. Typography is very
important!</p>

<pre>
p {
  font: 1.2em helvetica, serif;
  line-height: 1.6;
}
</pre>

<p>OMG I CAN READ!!!!!</p>

<p>What else can you do with a table and CSS? How about
coloring?</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>mon</th>
    <th>tue</th>
    <th>wed</th>
    <th>thu</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>20</td>
    <td>21</td>
    <td>22</td>
    <td>23</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>27</td>
    <td>28</td>
    <td>29</td>
    <td>30</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<pre>
table th {
  background-color: #F58C8C;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  font-family: helvetica, sans-serif;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #333;
  margin: 1em;
}
</pre>

<p>What about some padding?</p>

<pre>
table th {
  padding: 1em;
  background-color: #F58C8C;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  font-family: helvetica, sans-serif;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #333;
  margin: 1em;
}

table td {
  padding: 2em;
  font-family: courier, serif;
  letter-spacing: 1px;
  margin: 1em;
}
</pre>

<p>Hell yeah! Now that is better. And it's a good thing
because today's lesson is officially over! But don't
despair! I got some Ruby extra credit for ya if that
kind of thing makes you tingle somewhere.</p>

<p>No.. like in your heart! Dirty minds... all of ya!</p>
