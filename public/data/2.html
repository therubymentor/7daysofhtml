<h1>Welcome back!</h1>
<h2>Today, we get an intro to CSS!</h2>

<p>See the window pane to the left and on the bottom
half? That represents a <em>CSS file</em> and in this
case, the one that directly effects the HTML to the 
left and above. The <strong>body</strong> section of
the CSS will effect everything in the HTML section.
</p>

<hr>

<p>To see how this works, change the text in the CSS 
window by adding the following text to the:
<strong>body</strong> section.</p>

<pre>  padding: 16px;</pre>

<p>See how the text moved inward from the
<em>container</em>? (The container being everything in
the body!) You just <em>styled</em> the <em>HTML</em>
using <strong>CSS</strong>. Now let's make those
headings a bit nicer.</p>

<p>Create a new "CSS block" under the body block in the
CSS window. It should look like this:</p>

<pre>h1 {

}</pre>

<p>Then we will change the alignment by changing
<strong>text-align</strong> to center like so:</p>

<pre>h1 {
  text-align: center;
}</pre>

<p>We can also make things align to the right side of
the container. Let's make the h2 tag hang out on the
right side of things with the following CSS:</p>

<pre>h2 {
  text-align: right;
}</pre>

<hr>

<p>So far we have been styling HTML <strong>elements</strong>
or <em>tags</em>. We can also style those same elements
not by their element name, but by an ID or a CLASS.
Allow me to demonstrate with the following HTML:</p>

<pre>
&lt;div id="person"&gt;
  &lt;div class="info name"&gt;Jim OKelly&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="info email"&gt;heyasshole@rubymentor.io&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<p>That was me displaying the code on the page here for
you to see. Now comes the real thing that we will 
style:</p>

<div id="person">
    <div class="info name">Jim OKelly</div>
      <div class="info email">heyasshole@rubymentor.io</div>
</div>

<p>To change those divs, let's start with the outside
container that has an ID. The first thing you should
know about IDs is that they are unique. If you put
two elements on the same page and give them the same
ID, don't expect shit to work.</p>

<p>Add this to your CSS window:</p>

<pre>
div#person {
  margin-left: 1em;
  padding-left: 1em;
  border-left: 1px solid #333;
}
</pre>

<p>You should now see the whole block of text move
to the right, get a vertical line, a bit more padding
and then the text. We added both a margin and some
padding, and a left border.
</p>

<hr>

<p>You can use <strong>margin</strong> or 
<strong>margin-left/top/right/bottom</strong>
to add space <em>outside</em> the container,
and <strong>padding</strong> or 
<strong>padding-left/top/right/bottom</strong>
to add space <em>inside</em> the container.</p>

<p>You can also use <strong>border</strong> or 
<strong>border-left/top/right/bottom</strong>
to add, yep... a border. Notice the arguments
to the style, we need a width, a type of line
(it could be dotted for instance) and a color.</p>

<p>A color like <strong>#333</strong> is what is known
as a <em>HEX</em> number color. You can also use
colors like <em>red</em> or <em>blue</em>. This
applies to all colors in CSS.</p>

<p>Now let's finish up with some changes to a
<strong>class</strong> or two. Add the following
CSS:</p>

<pre>
.info {
  padding: 0.5em;
}

.name {
  font-weight: bold;
}

.email {
  font-style: italic;
}
</pre>

<p>As you can see, we can effect different elements
by adding CSS rules to class names and then applying
that class to the element. Classes are not unique
and can be added on many different HTML elements.</p>

<h3>HOMEWORK</h3>

Didn't your Mother tell you not to play with yourself?
Well, I say bullshit. Play with it. Make changes. See
what happens. Play 2 year old scientist here with
IDs and CLASSES. Sprinkle them in the text in this
lesson and see what happens.</p>

<p>Remember, you can always click the RESET link at
the bottom and start over! See you next session,
like this time, you will get an email with the link.
