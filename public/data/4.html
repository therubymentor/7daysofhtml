<h1>Today we are going to learn about lists!</h1>
<p>You have probably seen horizontal navigation lists
around the interwebs and you didn't realize it was
just a list with some style. Take the following
horizontal list. Don't worry, I won't press charges.</p>

<pre>
&lt;ul class="horizontal-list"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a href="https://rubymentor.io"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt; 
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a href="https://blog.rubymentor.io"&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt; 
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a href="https://guides.rubymentor.io"&gt;Guides&lt;/a&gt; 
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>

<p>Here is the <em>same</em> list but actually displayed
as HTML instead of having the HTML <em>rendered</em>. By
the way, I put that in a &lt;pre&gt; tag to make it keep
the spacing and formatting.</p>

<ul class="horizontal-list">
  <li>
    <a href="https://rubymentor.io">Home</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://blog.rubymentor.io">Blog</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://guides.rubymentor.io">Guides</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Noticed how the <em>natural</em> display of a list
is to do a veritcal, bullet point based ist. Now let's
change it to be <em>inline</em> which is the first step
to having a horizontal list. In the CSS pane to the left
add an class:</p>

<pre>
.horizontal-list {
  display: inline;
  list-style: none;
}
</pre>

<p>We still aren't flowing horizontally. And we still have
bullets depending on the browser. The next step would be
to scope this class to ul and li:</p>

<pre>
ul.horizontal-list li {
  display: inline;
  list-style: none;
}
</pre>

<p>Wow, that is already looking better! But we need to add
some padding between these elements now so they aren't
jammed up into each other like cars on the LA freeways.
</p>

<p>We will now add one more designator to this list
to put some distance between the li elements:</p>

<pre>
ul.horizontal-list li {
  display: inline;
  margin-right: 1em;
}
</pre>

<ul class="horizontal-list">
  <li>
    <a href="https://rubymentor.io">Home</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://blog.rubymentor.io">Blog</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://guides.rubymentor.io">Guides</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Wow, that did something! What if you wanted to
put <em>pipe</em> character seperators in between
the list items?</p>

<p>Well, that would require us to use some <em>
pseudo elements</em>, namely the <strong>:after</strong>
designator. So add the following CSS now:</p>

<pre>
ul.horizontal-list li:after {
  content: " |";
  margin-left: 1em;
}
</pre>

<p>We are almost there! But we really didn't want to 
have a pipe after the <em>last</em> li element. We
can fix this with another pseudo designator, this time
the <strong>last-child</strong> and another 
<strong>after</strong> like so:</p>

<pre>
ul.horizontal-list li:last-child:after {
  content: "";
}
</pre>

<p>That's it for today!. Next time we will dig into the
mysteries of images! See you then. Happy hacking and 
keep on a codin'.</p>
