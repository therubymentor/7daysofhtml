<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<h2>To the 7 Day HTML/CSS Bootcamp!</h2>

<p>In the top pane on the left-hand side you will find
a black window. In that window there is text that has
been <em>marked-up</em> with <strong>HTML</strong>. I
use the term <em>marked-up</em>, because <em>HTML
</em> stands for <strong>H</strong>yper <strong>
  T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup 
<strong>L</strong>anguage.</p>

<h4>Simple emphasis and boldening</h4>

<p>You can seperate <em>paragraphs</em> of text using
&lt;p&gt; "tags" or "elements". You can <em>emphasize</em>
text using &lt;em&gt; tags, and you can <strong>bolden</strong>
text using &lt;strong&gt; tags. Although it can get
obnoxious pretty quick. Be glad you didn't have to
deal with &lt;blink&gt; tags!</p>

<p>These HTML elements, or HTML "tags" need a beginning and
an end. So if the start tag is &lt;p&gt;, the end tag
needs to be &lt;/p&gt;. Notice the forward-slash, that
is the key to closing an element.</p>

<p>So far we have just learned a few ways of "decorating"
text. Usually that is the job of <strong>CSS</strong>
but let's ignore the for just the moment, and continue
on with HTML.</p>

<h4>People love making lists</h4>

<p>In HTML you can define lists of things, for instance,
this is called an <stong>unordered</strong> list:</p>

<strong>Fruits</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Apples</li>
      <li>Oranges</li>
        <li>Pears</li>
          <li>Blueberries</li>
</ul>

<p>But not all lists are <em>unordered</em>, some are 
<strong>ordered</strong>, like this one right here:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Put on your VR headseat</li>
      <li>Press the big play button in front of you</li>
        <li>TAKE COVER!</li>
          <li>Keep moving, camper</li>
</ol>

<p>Lists are also used in <em>interesting</em> ways 
like horizontal menus, usually seen at the top of web
pages. They are also great candidates for Chapter
lists and tables of contents.</p>
</p>

<h4>Using HTML as structure</h4>

<p>There are two kinds of "tags", the kind that have
what we call a "block" display, meaning it takes up a
<em>block</em> of space, and "inline", and they just
flow.</p>

<p>Let's look at some of these mysterious 
<strong>block</strong> elements, starting with the 
<strong>&lt;div&gt;</strong> tag. This tag will 
<em>break</em> the flow. An example:</p>

<div>I am a div, and therefore, block</div>
<strong>I am a strong, and therefore, inline</strong>
<em>I am an em, and therefore, inline. Notice
I did not "break the flow"</em>
<div>Here comes another &lt;div&gt; to <em>break</em>
the flow! Jerk thinks he is a Bizkit.</div>

<p>Typically, a &lt;div&gt; tag is used to block 
off some text, like a section, or a row, or a "box"
of some sorts.</p>

<p>Without the help of <strong>CSS</strong> divs don't
really do much, come to think of it!</p>

<hr>

<p>You should spend some time on this page changing
content in the HTML section to see what happens!</p>

<p>That is it for the first day. Tomorrow we start
learning CSS!</p>
